Gentoo Overlay
==============

This is my personal Gentoo overlay. I use it to customize some ebuilds to my needs.
Ebuilds in here are mainly for my own usage, though they are of reasonable quality and do not conflict with the official portage tree.

Some ebuilds are copied from other sources. I will try to keep the copyright as complete as possible.

Usage
-----

Add this overlay with [Layman](http://layman.sourceforge.net/) like this:

    layman -o https://raw.github.com/m4rcu5/gentoo-overlay/master/repository.xml -f -a m4rcu5
