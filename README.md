Gentoo Overlay
==============

This is my Gentoo overlay containing ebuilds i found either missing or outdated in the official repository or other overlays.
Ebuilds in here are mainly for my own usage, though they are of reasonable quality and do not conflict with the official portage tree.

Some ebuilds are copied from other sources. I will try to keep the attributions intact.

Usage
-----

Add this overlay with [Layman](http://layman.sourceforge.net/) like this:

    layman -o https://raw.github.com/m4rcu5/gentoo-overlay/master/repository.xml -f -a m4rcu5


Bugs/Updates
------------

If you find a bug, or outdated ebuilds, please use the GitHub issue tracker to report them. Pull-requests are also welcome.
